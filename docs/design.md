# MVP

User will keep track of their workout in a text file (Google Keep for example) and when completed the user
will upload that text file to the web app which will automatically parse and store the workout accurately.

The app will then be able to keep track of the day, exercises, sets, reps etc of the user over time.


# Future

* Calendar to show the user when they completed a workout
* Some way to integrate with Google Keep/Docs to automatically retrieve uploaded workouts
